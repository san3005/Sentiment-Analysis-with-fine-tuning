## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a sophisticated sentiment analysis system for financial news headlines using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model with fine-tuning. The system analyzes news headlines and classifies their sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral with high accuracy.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Custom fine-tuning of GPT-3.5 for financial sentiment analysis
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics and confusion matrix visualization
- Support for both zero-shot and few-shot learning approaches
- Detailed performance analysis with precision, recall, and F1 scores
- Real-time sentiment prediction for new headlines

## 📊 Performance Metrics

- Base Accuracy: 88.24% (Zero-shot)
- Fine-tuned Model Accuracy: 90.80%
- Robust performance across all sentiment classes
- High precision in neutral and negative classifications

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

The project includes:

- Data preparation and preprocessing
- Model fine-tuning with OpenAI API
- Confusion matrix visualization
- Classification report generation
- Real-world testing with current news headlines

## 📝 Prerequisites

```python
pip install openai pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib sklearn
```

## 🔧 Usage

1. Set up OpenAI API credentials
2. Prepare training data in JSONL format
3. Fine-tune the model
4. Run sentiment analysis on new headlines

## 📈 Results Visualization
